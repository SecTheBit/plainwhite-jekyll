Hello folks!!! In this series of Active Directory , I am back with a new blog regarding kerberoes authentication and attacks. We will start with some basics of kerberos and then move to the attacking part. If you have any doubts regarding any topic or if you think that the topics are not well explained , feel free to contact me.

## What is Kerberos

Kerberos is named after a famous three headed gaurd dogs in the Greek methodology. Basically it is Authentication Protocol for the windows operating system , developed by the Massachusetts Institue of Technology for a project called Athena. Kerberos is not a Authorization protocol, it only verifies the identity of the the users , it does not tell what resources a user can access. 

## Some of the Agents involve in Kerberos:

1. *Server* : The server which the user wants to access for the service or resource.

2. *Client* : The server which acts on behalf of the user for accessing the resource from the server.

3. *Key Distribution Centre* : The Key Distribution centre or KDC is a truted authority in Active Directory which is responsible for providing the service to the users by providing them tickets and session keys , and is installed on every Domain Cotroller.

## Tickets Provided by KDC:

1. TGTs : Ticket granting Tickets are the tickets being deliverd by the KDC , on the request of user for the *TGTs*.It includes username, Session Key, Expiration Date and *PAC* with user privileges.

2. TGS : Ticket Granting Service is the tickets which users uses for the taking the service from any service account. It includes 
username, Session key, Expiration Date of the TGS and *PAC*, signed by KDC.

*PAC or Privilege Attribute CAertificate , is an extension to the Kerberos ticket that contain the privilege of the user. When users use their Kerberos tickets to authenticate to other systems, the PAC can be read and used to determine their level of privileges without reaching out to the domain controller to query for that information .

## Keys used in Kerberos:

1. User Key: It is the ntlm hash of the user which want to access the service.
2. Service Key: It is the nlm hash of the service account.
3. Session Key: It is the key which is provided when the client is interacting eith the KDC.
4. Service Session Key: It is the key provided when the client is interacting with the service account server.
5. Krbtgt Key: It is the ntlm hash of the *krbtgt account*.


## Authentication Process 

The kerberos Authentication consist of five steps, condsider the following diagram.

1. KRB_AS_REQ : In this step the client request for the TGT from the key distribution centre. IN this process , the ntlm hash of the user with a timestamp is being sent to the KDC for the pre-authentication purpose.

2. KRB_AS_REP : IN this step , first KDC verifies the identity of the user with the given hash and timestamp , and then it reply with the TGT to the user. 

3. KRB_TGS_REQ : In this step , the client after getting the TGT , request for the TGS . In this process . the timestamp and TGT are being provided to the KDC.

4. KRB_TGS_REP : The KDC will reply with the TGS , after getting the request for it.

5. KRB_AP_REQ  : IN the last step, the client will access the service from the application server with the help of TGS.

This is the whole authentication process involved in kerberos. Much for the theory part, now we will move to the attacking part.

## Attacks against Kerberos Protocol

1. Kerberos BruteForce:

In this attack basically we do bruteforce attack against the kerberos protocol, in order to get the usernames and passwords of the users. You only need connectivity with the DC, no user level pivileges are required for this. HOwever this attack can led to blocking of the users, so you need to be carefull while performing this attack.


2. AS_REPRoast:

In the first step of authentication, we have seen that after doing the pre-authentication, KDC will reply for the TGT. But sometimes the *DONT_REQ_PREAUTH* flag is set in some users , so that the KDC do not check for users password and will reply to any of the request for TGT. So in that case we can request for TGT with a set of usernames and if by chance any user have that flag set then the KDC will reply with the TGT, AS_REP, which will contain the user hash. YOu only need connectivity with the KDC , no need of extra privileges are required.

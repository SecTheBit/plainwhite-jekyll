Hello folks!!! In this blog , I would show you how I have done Phishing via HTA (HTML Application ) file when i got access to the email of one of their employee during a pentest.

## Introduction To HTA File

HTA files are the HTML Application , which can execute the contents without browser sanbox restriction, and executed by default by a Microsoft Signed Binary , called as mshta.exe. With some Obfuscation , HTA files can really help to bypass the AV and Defender , because these files have not been fully identified. Other files like exe, have an higher chance of being detected.

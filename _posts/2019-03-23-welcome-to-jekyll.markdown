### Hello folks!!! hope you all are doing well , I am here to write a blog on the basics of *Active Directory* , and i hope you all like it. We will start with some definitions and then go to the Domain Enumeration part.
### Active Directory is simply a Directory Service that was developed by Microsoft in the mid 1990s to replace the old Windows-NT style user authentication. It stores information about all the objects like computer, users, printers, shares , etc. you can think it as a phonebook for windows. It helps to manage all the objects under a domain in an efficient manner withe the help of LDAP (Leight weight Directory Access Prototcol)

###Leight Weight 


```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
